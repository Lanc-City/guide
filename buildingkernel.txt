There are two ways to build kernel
1) BUILD WITHIN ROM SOURCE
2) BUILD STANDALONE

BUILD WITHIN ROM SOURCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make bootimage

BUILD STANDALONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download the source from Samsungs OSRC, you will have a ZIP, inside it is something like "kernel.tar.gz"
Extract that one and you get your kernel source looking stuff
If we look in your ROM for example EvoX, you see it has some toolchains in the "prebuilt" folder
We need this toolchains to build the kernel
You can point it to this one or you can download the toolchains separately
DOWNLOAD TOOLCHAIN FROM --->

export CROSS_COMPILE=YourPath <—- Here is our toolchain path


export SUBARCH=arm64
export ARCH=arm64            <——- You can see these in your boardconfig too


export ANDROID_MAJOR_VERSION=q <—— this is required for Samsung since else WiFi and stuff breaks, always some random bugs happen

make -j$(nproc --all)
We must before running make "make defconfig"
